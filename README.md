# MC_SVEquipmentStackSplit
  
Backup your save before using any mods.  
  
Uninstall any mods and attempt to replicate issues before reporting any suspected base game bugs on official channels.  
  
Function  
========  
- Stacks of active equipment (mainly thinking drones and tractor beams) of the same rarity can now be split and assigned separate hotkeys.  
- Adds a new button to the hangar screen in stations.  

Note this button isn't "intelligent".  It is always enabled, but you should get error messages rather than full on crashes if you try to use it on a non-activated equipment, weapon or something else clever.
